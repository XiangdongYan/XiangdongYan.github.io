üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Skills
------
With a versatile technical acumen, I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, MATLAB, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS, and Fortran90 (sometime), leveraging these tools to architect robust, scalable solutions for complex engineering challenges. 

Complementing my programming proficiency, I specialize in advanced mechanical analysis (FEA) and Building Information Modeling (BIM), employing industry-leading platforms including ADINA, SOLIDWORKS, Autodesk CAD, Revit, Fusion 360, and Blender to perform high-fidelity simulations and construct intricate 3D models. 

My experience in Unreal Engine further bridges virtual prototyping and immersive visualization, ensuring meticulous precision from concept to execution. This interdisciplinary expertise empowers me to deliver innovative, end-to-end engineering solutions that harmonize computational rigor with creative problem-solving.


üåü Hobbies
------
I am an avid reader and writer, passions that fuel creativity and broaden my perspective. Music serves as both a creative outlet and a source of inspiration‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm unwinding with the harmonica or drawing energy from curated playlists. 

To balance mental focus with physical vitality, I embrace outdoor pursuits like swimming, skiing, trail running, and mountaineering. These activities challenge me to grow while fostering discipline, resilience, and a deep appreciation for the natural world.
