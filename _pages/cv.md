üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Skills
------
With a versatile technical acumen, I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, MATLAB, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS, and Fortran90 (sometime), leveraging these tools to architect robust, scalable solutions for complex engineering challenges. 

Complementing my programming proficiency, I specialize in advanced mechanical analysis (FEA) and Building Information Modeling (BIM), employing industry-leading platforms including ADINA, SOLIDWORKS, Autodesk CAD, Revit, Fusion 360, and Blender to perform high-fidelity simulations and construct intricate 3D models. 

My experience in Unreal Engine further bridges virtual prototyping and immersive visualization, ensuring meticulous precision from concept to execution. This interdisciplinary expertise empowers me to deliver innovative, end-to-end engineering solutions that harmonize computational rigor with creative problem-solving.


üåü Hobbies
------
Beyond technical endeavors, I nurture a lifelong passion for literary exploration and creative expression, channeling ideas into written narratives. 

Melodic introspection through the harmonica and curated auditory inspiration serve as meditative counterpoints, balancing analytical rigor with creative rejuvenation. Equally vital are my pursuits in nature‚Äîswimming, skiing, trail running, and alpine ascents‚Äîwhere physical vitality meets strategic discipline, fostering resilience through communion with untamed landscapes. 

Together, these practices cultivate a harmonious equilibrium between mind, craft, and body, grounding my ethos of approaching life‚Äôs challenges with artistry, intention, and an enduring reverence for growth.

*"The harmonica is the only instrument that breathes. When you play it, you‚Äôre breathing poetry."*
