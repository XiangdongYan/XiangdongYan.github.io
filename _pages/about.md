Hello! I’m **Xiangdong Yan**, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. My research centers on leveraging advanced **computer vision and deep learning** techniques to enhance **quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC)** of civil infrastructure.

My current work focuses on developing modular frameworks for **semantic and instance segmentation** of high-resolution **LiDAR point clouds**, integrating cross-modal vision-language models (e.g., CLIP, Grounded-SAM), and applying 3D neural rendering techniques (e.g., Gaussian Splatting, NeRF) for spatially coherent infrastructure analysis. Through this, I aim to improve 3D structural modeling, finite element meshing, and asset monitoring protocols.

I also have experience in photometric stereo, stereo vision systems, and numerical modeling for concrete behavior under dynamic loading conditions. My interdisciplinary background spans **civil engineering, artificial intelligence, and structural mechanics**, enabling me to design data-driven solutions for real-world engineering challenges.

With international research and academic experience in China, Japan, and the United States, I am fluent in Chinese, Japanese, and English. This multicultural perspective enriches my collaborative approach and enhances my ability to contribute to global research initiatives.

🔹 *"We are standing on the shore of the unknown, a vast ocean of mystery stretching before us. To live seriously is to sail bravely into those depths, guided not by fear but by the stars of curiosity and compassion. For every truth uncovered is a lantern lit for those who follow."*  
*— **Adapted from Carl Sagan & Mary Shelley***  

🔹 *"Science is not a cold ledger of facts, nor life a mere tally of days. True research is a love affair with the unknown—a courtship of questions, a marriage of patience and insight. And a life well-lived? It is the poetry we write with our choices, stanza by deliberate stanza."*
