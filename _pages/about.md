Hi! I am **Xiangdong (sheldon)**, welcome to my pages!

My current research focuses on developing advanced **Deep Learning-based Computer Vision** techniques to enhance quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) processes for civil infrastructure, with a particular emphasis on **3D reconstruction**, image and LiDAR point cloud recognition as well as high-resolution semantic segmentation, aim at addressing critical challenges in infrastructure assessment. 

You are very welcome to [contact me](xiy144@pitt.edu) if you have any thoughts!


News!!!
------
2025.01.05 - I just completed the **104th TRB** ([Transportation Research Board](https://trb-annual-meeting.nationalacademies.org/)) held in Washington D.C. this year! Here for more info.

2025.08.26 - Starting a new HD LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation project of [IRISE](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/subsites/consortiums/irise/research/active-projects/), collaboration is welcome!

2025.08.25 - I attended the **13th ICCP** ([International Conference on Concrete Pavements](https://13thiccp.concretepavements.org/)) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, organized by ISCP. It was so impressive! [Here](https://13thiccp.concretepavements.org/workshops/deep-learning-based-entrapped-air-segmentation-and-evaluation-ease-for-plain-concrete-pavement-applications/) is my work.
