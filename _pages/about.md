Hello! I’m **Xiangdong Yan**, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. My research centers on leveraging advanced **computer vision and deep learning** techniques to enhance **quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC)** of civil infrastructure.

My current work focuses on developing modular frameworks for **semantic and instance segmentation** of high-resolution **LiDAR point clouds**, integrating cross-modal vision-language models (e.g., CLIP, Grounded-SAM), and applying 3D neural rendering techniques (e.g., Gaussian Splatting, NeRF) for spatially coherent infrastructure analysis. Through this, I aim to improve 3D structural modeling, finite element meshing, and asset monitoring protocols.

I also have experience in photometric stereo, stereo vision systems, and numerical modeling for concrete behavior under dynamic loading conditions. My interdisciplinary background spans **civil engineering, artificial intelligence, and structural mechanics**, enabling me to design data-driven solutions for real-world engineering challenges.

With international research and academic experience in China, Japan, and the United States, I am fluent in Chinese, Japanese, and English. This multicultural perspective enriches my collaborative approach and enhances my ability to contribute to global research initiatives.
