## Abstract

This project aims to develop a robust methodology for the **3D Mesoscale Mechanical Characterization** of **Compaction and Consolidation** for pavement concrete, focusing on the spatial distribution of aggregates and their impact on consolidation quality. This task involves three key phases:

**1. Mathematical Representation of Aggregate Morphology** – Spherical harmonic expansion is used to create a mathematical model of aggregate shapes, capturing their geometric complexity. To generate realistic "digital" aggregates, random field theory is applied, allowing for controlled variability in shape and size while maintaining morphological accuracy.

**2. Discrete Element Method (DEM) Simulations** – This phase simulates the spatial arrangement of aggregates in a given mix design. DEM simulations optimize aggregate placement to achieve an idealized distribution, serving as a reference standard for evaluating real-world concrete specimens. The approach ensures that particle interactions, including contacts and compaction behavior, are realistically modeled to reflect field conditions.

**3. Assessment of Aggregate Spatial Distribution** – Image analysis techniques, including those developed before, are applied to quantify the deviation of real concrete samples from the optimal aggregate distribution. The evaluation system analyzes aggregate orientation, spacing, and dispersion to assess consolidation quality. The findings help refine vibration parameters, ensuring uniform aggregate distribution and improved concrete durability.

By integrating advanced mathematical modeling, simulation techniques, and image-based analysis, this research provides a scientifically rigorous framework for assessing and optimizing concrete consolidation during slipform paving​.
