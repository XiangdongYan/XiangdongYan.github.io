## Project Summary

This project develops a **high-fidelity Digital Twin (DT) of the Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation (MCSI)** at the University of Pittsburgh to model and optimize the energy and environmental performance of climate-adaptive buildings. My primary role is the **Digital Twin Modeling**, integrating multi-source data streams into a unified framework to support real-time assessment, visualization, and decision-making.

The framework combines high-resolution **LiDAR-based reality capture** with **Building Information Modeling (BIM)** and building automation system (BAS) sensor data (air quality, occupancy, energy use, water usage). These are harmonized into a six-layer Digital Twin architecture that enables predictive modeling under varying climate scenarios.

### Objectives

- Create a **high-resolution 3D reconstruction** of the MCSI using terrestrial LiDAR and thermal imaging.  
- Align and integrate BIM models with LiDAR point clouds using Dynamo scripting.  
- Fuse **real-time BAS sensor data** with physics-based and data-driven models for energy, emissions, and comfort.  
- Implement **Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment (DLCA)** to evaluate climate-change-driven impacts.  
- Provide a scalable Digital Twin framework to inform **climate-adaptive building design** and sustainable operations.  


### Key Results (In Progress)

- Completed preliminary **digital shadow** of MCSI integrating LiDAR scans and BIM geometry.  
- Established automated pipelines for **BIM–point cloud subdivision** and feature extraction.  
- Integrated BAS sensor data into a live DT environment, enabling real-time visualization of environmental and energy performance.  
- Designed multi-layer DT architecture incorporating physical twin, IoT connectivity, data repositories, and simulation tools (EnergyPlus, DLCA).
