## Summary

This research explored the development of lightweight concrete incorporating Core-Shell Structured Aggregates (CSA), targeting an optimal balance between reduced density and retained mechanical strength. The work involved extensive experimental testing and finite element simulations to study the influence of aggregate shape, distribution, and material on mechanical performance.

A novel capsule-shaped CSA was designed and evaluated for its ability to reduce weight while maintaining structural integrity. Key findings showed that steel-based CCSA achieved a 16–19% density reduction while retaining up to 92% of compressive strength. The research demonstrates the feasibility of CSA-enhanced lightweight aggregate concrete for structural applications.

### Key Results

- Developed capsule-shaped CSA that significantly reduced density while preserving strength.
- Conducted full-scale experiments and finite element analysis for parameter optimization.
- Validated effectiveness of aggregate surface treatment in improving interfacial bonding and crack resistance.
