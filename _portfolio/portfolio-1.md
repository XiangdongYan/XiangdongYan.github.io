title: "2022-2024: Computer vision-based quality control techniques for slipform paving"
excerpt: "This project develops computer vision-based quality control techniques for slipform paving by analyzing the effects of vibration on concrete consolidation and aggregate dispersion. A Paver Consolidation Simulator (PaCS) replicates field conditions, integrating a binocular stereo-vision system and accelerometers for real-time monitoring. The transformer based model segments aggregates and air voids, while photometric stereo analyzes void networks. This approach enables non-invasive, real-time optimization of slipform paving to enhance pavement quality and durabilityâ€‹
