Abstract


This project aims to develop **advanced computer vision-based quality control** techniques for **slipform paving**, focusing on the effects of vibration frequency and duration on concrete fluidization and consolidation. To achieve this, a Paver Consolidation Simulator (PaCS) is designed to replicate field paving conditions in a controlled laboratory setting. This system integrates a binocular stereo-vision setup with accelerometers to capture both internal and external responses of the concrete during vibration, allowing for real-time analysis of material behavior.

The research leverages deep learning-based segmentation techniques, including a **Transformer-Architecture** based pretrained model, to automatically identify and classify aggregates and entrapped air voids within concrete cross-sections. This enables precise evaluation of how vibration influences the spatial distribution of concrete constituents. Additionally, a photometric stereo approach is employed to analyze the microstructural characteristics of entrapped and entrained air void networks, providing insights into their connectivity and distribution.

By combining stereo vision, deep learning segmentation, and photometric analysis, this task establishes an innovative, non-invasive methodology for **real-time monitoring** of slipform paving. The findings will contribute to optimizing vibration parameters, ensuring uniform concrete consolidation, and improving the long-term durability and performance of pavement structures
