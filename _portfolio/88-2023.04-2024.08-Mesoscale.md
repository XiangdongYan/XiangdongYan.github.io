title: "2023.04–2024.08: 3D Mesoscale Modeling of Concrete Consolidation and Packing Behavior"
excerpt: "Established a physics-informed 3D mesoscale framework that combines spherical harmonic expansion, stochastic morphology generation, and DEM simulations to investigate aggregate packing and consolidation in slipform paving. The framework enables quantitative evaluation of vibratory energy transmission, aggregate distribution uniformity, and mortar–aggregate interactions under varying compaction conditions. This approach bridges experimental measurements with predictive modeling, providing a robust basis for optimizing construction parameters to achieve superior consolidation quality."

## Summary

This research develops a comprehensive computational framework for the **3D Mesoscale Characterization** of **Concrete Compaction and Consolidation** during slipform paving. By leveraging spherical harmonics to mathematically represent aggregate morphology, discrete element method (DEM) simulations to model spatial packing, and image-based analysis for validation, the project establishes a robust method for evaluating internal structure and consolidation quality of concrete.

### Objectives

- Develop a mathematical framework using spherical harmonics for aggregate shape representation.
- Implement stochastic aggregate synthesis with controllable variability using phase-scaling techniques.
- Simulate ideal packing of aggregates using discrete element modeling.
- Benchmark real-world concrete samples against statistically representative idealized packing distributions.
- Support quantitative assessment of vibration-induced consolidation performance.

### Key Results

- Developed a **phase-controlled spectral synthesis** method to generate morphologically realistic synthetic aggregates.
- Built a **DEM-based simulation** framework that enables optimal spatial distribution of aggregates under packing constraints.
- Performed a **Monte Carlo analysis** on DEM outputs to establish benchmark indicators for aggregate spacing, mortar-to-aggregate ratio, and effective centroid shift.
- Validated simulation results against laboratory cross-sections obtained from vibrated concrete specimens.
