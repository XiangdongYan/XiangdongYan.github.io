## Summary

This project establishes a comprehensive, computer vision-based framework for **non-invasive, real-time quality control** of concrete consolidation in slipform paving. It combines a Paver Consolidation Simulator (PaCS) with stereo-vision, photometric stereo, and deep learning to evaluate the fluidization behavior of fresh concrete under vibration. The framework is designed to address limitations of manual inspections by enabling objective, automated tracking of entrapped air voids and aggregate spatial distribution.

A custom photometric stereo system and transformer-based image segmentation algorithm are developed to quantify air void content and distribution based on ASTM C457. The vision system evaluates how different vibration intensities influence concrete consolidation, enabling rapid feedback and optimization for construction engineers. Together, these innovations enhance QA/QC protocols for horizontal infrastructure, such as pavements and runways.

### Objectives

- Build an instrumented platform (PaCS) to simulate slipform paving conditions in the lab.
- Evaluate the effect of vibration parameters on entrapped air distribution using stereo vision and accelerometers.
- Develop a **Photometric Stereo–Vision Transformer** framework for automating ASTM C457 air void analysis.
- Design real-time segmentation pipelines using **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** and geometric filtering.
- Validate air void analysis results against traditional petrographic reports and Procedure A/B from ASTM C457.

### Key Results

- Designed and validated an 8-LED photometric stereo system capable of high-resolution void detection.
- Proposed a segmentation framework combining SAM, depth-guided filtering, and gradient masking to isolate voids.
- Achieved over **97% accuracy** in void content and spacing factor estimation, benchmarked against petrographic analysis.
- Quantified the influence of vibration frequency and traverse spacing on void metrics through parametric sensitivity studies.
- Published experimental validation using both manual and automatic analysis on vibrated concrete specimens.
