## Abstract

This project aims to advance deep learning-based **high-resolution 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS)** for civil infrastructure applications. This task is divided into three key phases. First, it investigates the current state of 3D PCSS, focusing on techniques that classify each point in a point cloud to provide detailed semantic understanding of civil structures. This includes evaluating various sensing technologies, such as photogrammetry, RGB-D cameras, and LiDAR-based methods (ALS, ULS, TLS, and MLS), to determine their effectiveness in civil engineering applications.

Next, the research systematically applies state-of-the-art 3D PCSS algorithms to real-world infrastructure projects, assessing their performance in scenarios such as defect detection, construction site monitoring, and structural assessments. Given the challenges associated with large-scale point clouds, complex geometries, and environmental variability, the study rigorously evaluates the **practical limitations and computational efficiency** of these models, with a focus on recent Transformer-based architectures for improved segmentation accuracy.

Finally, the task explores the potential of cutting-edge 3D reconstruction techniques, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), to enhance infrastructure modeling, monitoring, and visualization. By leveraging these advanced methodologies, the research seeks to overcome current challenges in **real-time 3D scene understanding**, automated structural inspections, and digital twin applications for civil infrastructure. The outcomes of this study will contribute to the development of more robust, scalable, and intelligent PCSS frameworks, 
enabling highly accurate and efficient infrastructure assessment and maintenance​.
