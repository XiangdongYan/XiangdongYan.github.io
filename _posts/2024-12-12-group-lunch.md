Our group celebrated the end of a productive semester with a lunch at Spirits & Tales, located in the heart of Oakland. The event brought together students and faculty in a casual setting to reflect on our progress, exchange stories, and enjoy a well-deserved break. It was a great opportunity to foster camaraderie and recharge before the holidays.
