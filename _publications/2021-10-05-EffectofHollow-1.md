Bubble concrete is a lightweight achieved by mixing high-strength hollow bodies into concrete. Bubble concrete 
is different from biaxial voided slabs, it can reduce the density of concrete while ensuring the strength. 
As the existence of the hollow body will greatly affect the stress distribution inside the concrete , in order to improve 
the strength of the bubble concrete, this study conducted a nonlinear elastoplastic analysis with four different 
hollow body models. The optimal hollow body model is determined by comparing the stress distribution states inside the concrete. 
Based on the analytical results, as the capsule model inherits the good force transfer mechanism of the sphere, it can well 
reduce the lateral expansion of the hemisphere and further reduce the amount of concrete. Therefore, the capsule model is the best 
hollow body model for the bubble concrete in terms of stress distribution.
