This study proposes an approximate equation to evaluate the global buckling load of a single-layer cylindrical space frame without buckling analysis. In this research, large amounts of linear buckling analysis are carried out with various geometric parameters, and an imaginary stiffness G is proposed to represent the overall stiffness of the whole structure. Then, according to the influence of geometric parameters on buckling load factors and imaginary stiffness G, the authors derive an approximate equation based on regression analysis. Finally, the authors prove that the proposed approximate equations can evaluate the global buckling load in a high precision range.
