Served as Teaching Assistant for **CEE 1712/2713: Digitalization in Civil Engineering: From CAD to Virtual Reality**, an advanced undergraduate/graduate course introducing digital workflows in civil engineering. Assisted **Prof. Alessandro Fascetti** in delivering lectures and hands-on recitations.


Responsibilities included:

- Supported instruction in CAD, Building Information Modeling (BIM), photogrammetry, LiDAR-based reality capture, and immersive VR/AR applications for civil engineering design and visualization.  
- Guided students through hands-on tutorials with **AutoCAD, Revit, Reality Capture, and Twinmotion**, helping them translate raw survey data into interactive digital models.  
- Mentored student teams on a semester-long **digital twin project**, advising on model coordination, visualization workflows, and final VR-based presentations.  

This teaching role provided extensive engagement with **digitalization technologies** and allowed me to support students at the intersection of civil engineering and advanced computational tools.
